# ASDT_1

My name is **Kateryna Kononikhina** , I'm from Ukraine. I like to create websites, mostly the front-end part. I studied [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

>I think it is a fairly popular programming language and not very difficult.
Now I'm doing exercise 2A and adding some changes.
